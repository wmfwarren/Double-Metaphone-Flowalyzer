# Flowalyzer Using Double Metaphone


## The Algorithm
The Metaphone Algorithm was developed by Lawrence Philips to phonetically encode the way words sound with common letters. In the original algorithm, the words "Kline" and "Cline" result in the same code.

In the Double Metaphone each word results in a primary and secondary encoding.

## The Goal
The goal of this project is to use the Double Metaphone Algorithm to analyze the lyrics of rappers and figure you who has the dopest flows.
